        <p>
          Sometimes, a line of code will enter your life and change it like no other. That line of code won’t be like any other line of code youve seen before, although they're part of a program you may be familiar with. That line of code won’t friendly or understanding either. That line of code will push you to the limit. Enough said...

        <h2>Front-End Developer Unit 2</h2>
        <p>
          This project was a labor of love. Before becoming a front-end developer I worked extensively in the area of improving systems serving at-risk people.  My M.A. was actually in the area of policy and analysis and focused on workforce development.

        <p>
          As professionals with targets, projects to manage and bills to pay, we must perform, whether it’s the beginning of the week or the exhausting end of a long, hard one. And it’s precisely when times get tough that a good motivational build week is most beneficial, inspiring.

        <h2>Back-End Developer Unit 4</h2>
        <p>
          This project was quite enjoyable for me as it was a bit of an eye opener as to how far i have come since i started lambda. Im now 16 weeks into the program, It feels like it flew by. I feel as if i have learned so much and have come so far since i started. As much as i have loved this first 16 weeks at lambda, im 100% ready to move into labs and begin job hunting with confidence!
